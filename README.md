# React + Typescript + gulp + karma
This repository is for karma, gulp building exercises. 
I have not had much experience building front side applications.
I'm sorry if I made a mistake. And I'm sorry that my English is very cheap.  

## Note
I made this repository on December 15th, 2016.  
Please make sure that npm modules isn't deprecated, if you want to refer to this repository.
